Goal:

Create sketch impl of shared pointer.
Sketch means: no analysis for exception or thread safety, minimal interface

Refs:

(1) "Canonical Way" details are somewhere in Meyers, Alexandrescu, Sutter with implementation.
(2) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_pointer
(3) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting
(4) http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr

Plan:

1) read old synopsis of (1) in notes, (2), (3),and (4) (!! w/o "Implementation notes" and "Example" parts !!)
2) draw object scheme
3) write pseudocode
4) write interface in C++ without implementation
5) implement
6) test
7) diff with old synopsis of (1) & with (4)

Hints:

1) If stuck, read (4): "Implementation notes" and "Example"
2) If still stuck, read (1))
